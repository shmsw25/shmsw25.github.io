          <h3> Joining the Lab</h3>

          <p style="text-align: center"><b><em>&#10024;I will be recruiting Ph.D. students for the 2024&#8211;2025 cycle.&#10024;</em></b></p>

          <p style="margin-top: 10px">
            The theme for my lab will be "<strong>Language <span style="font-size: 150%">&#8746;</span> Generative AI</strong>". I am not looking for students who will work on specific topics. Rather, I am looking for students who will drive their own research agendas and do impactful work, which can be on any topics as long as they are related to language, generative AI, or both.
          </p>

          <!--<p style="margin-top: 20px">
            However, if you are curious what I've been finding exciting, the topics are as follows (but not limited to):
            <ul style="padding-top: 8px">
              <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
                <b>Demystifying Language Models</b>:
                  Let's push our understanding of language models and demystify them, either by analyzing their emergent behaviors (e.g. <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-main.759/" target="_blank">in-context learning</a>, <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.153/" target="_blank">chain-of-thought</a>) or by finding what it takes to create a good-performing model (<a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceFW/blogpost-fineweb-v1" target="_blank">example 1</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11794" target="_blank">example 2</a>).
              </li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
                <b>Distributed Language Models</b>:
                  I advocate for distributed language models: a set of model components with asymmetric use of the data, where which components to use can be flexible depending on which data is allowed to use.
                  I believe this direction is essential for (1)
                  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04430" target="_blank">models with responsible data use</a> and
                  (2) <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03306" target="_blank">efficient language model development</a>.
              </li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
                <b>Next-generation Foundation Models</b>:
                  How can we develop next-generation foundation models that solve
                  fundamental problems that current models have—factuality, hallucination, controllability, attribution, and continual learning—while also being <em>natively</em> multimodal,
                  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07185" target="_blank">more end-to-end</a>, and as small as possible?
              </li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
                <b>Language Model Auditing</b>:
                  Can we <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07841" target="_blank">detect</a> which copyrighted/non-permissive data the model is being trained on? Can we identify text generated by a model, a model that is fine-tuned from another model, or a model that is trained on text generated by another model?
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>-->

          <p style="margin-top: 20px">
            I am looking for students who (1) have a strong foundation in CS, ML, NLP, and coding, (2) are highly motivated, enthusiastic, and independent, (3) are communicative and collaborative, and (4) are critical thinkers with an open mind.
            I also place great importance on ethics (both in work and social contexts) and diversity.
            <!--Also, as this will be the first cohort of my students, it would be a great fit if you are interested in contributing to shaping the lab culture.-->
          </p>

              <b>If you are applying to the Ph.D. program:</b>

              Thank you for your interest! I will take Ph.D. students through UC Berkeley EECS - please refer to <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/academics/graduate/research-programs/admissions/" target="_blank">the department's admission page</a> for details. 

              <div class="blank" style="height: 8px"></div>
              The best way is to select me as a potential advisor on your application form AND to mention my name in the final paragraph of your Statement of Purpose. I will make sure to read all applications that mention my name.

              <div class="blank" style="height: 8px"></div>
              I apologize for not being able to respond to individual emails or schedule meetings due to the high volume of requests I receive. Please do not interpret this as a lack of interest!

              <b>If you are a M.S. student, a postdoc, or a visiting student:</b>
              At the moment, I do not plan to take a M.S. student, a postdoc, or a visiting student.

              I regularly receive emails from amazing students around the world who are interested in working with me, and I truly appreciate this interest. Unfortunately, due to my limited capacity, I can only advise UC Berkeley students. I apologize in advance as I may be unable to respond to these inquiries.

          <b>If you are looking for feedback on your Ph.D. application:</b>
          I apologize, but to maintain fairness, I am unable to provide feedback on your Ph.D. application.
