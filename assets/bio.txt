Sewon Min is a Ph.D. student in the Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington, advised by Prof. Luke Zettlemoyer and Prof. Hannaneh Hajishirzi. Her research is in the area of natural language processing and machine learning. Specifically, her Ph.D. work focuses on question answering (QA), natural language understanding and representation learning, including widening QA tasks to be more general and open-ended, and building scalable and generalizable QA systems. She is an active program committee member in the natural language processing conferences (ACL/EMNLP/NAACL/AACL/AKBC) and machine learning conferences (NeurIPS/ICLR/AAAI). She is a co-organizer of Workshop on Machine Reading for Question Answering at EMNLP 2021, Competition on Efficient Open-domain Question Answering at NeurIPS 2020, and Workshop on Structured and Unstructured KBs at AKBC 2020. Prior to UW, she received her B.S. in Computer Science & Engineering from Seoul National University. She also worked at Facebook AI Research, Google AI Research, and Salesforce Research.
