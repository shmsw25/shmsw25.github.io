				Hello! <br />
				I am an undergraduate student majoring in computer science and engineering. I am interested in deep learning, especially application in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. <br />
				I am highly motivated to learn and study more!

			<h3>Education</h3>
			<h4>Seoul National University (2014 - )</h4>
			<p>
				I am currently an undergraduate student. My classmates in CSE are super amazing.
			</p>
			<h4>University of Washington (2016) </h4>
			<p>
				I was an exchange student in the fall quarter of 2016. I took some CSE courses there. Seattle was the first city for me in US, and it's such a wonderful city!
			</p>
			<h4>Gyeonggi Science High School (2011 - 2013) </h4>
			<p>
				It is a special-purposed high school for students interested in math and science. I am 29th!

			<h3>Research Experience</h3>

			<h4>University of Washington (2016 - 2017)</h4>
			<p>
				I was an undergraduate research intern during my exchange program, advised by <a href="http://ssli.ee.washington.edu/~hannaneh/index.html" target="_blank">Hannaneh Hajishirzi</a> and <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ali/index.html" target="_blank">Ali Farhadi</a>.
				I worked on Textual Question Answering (given a context, answer to a question) and dialog interaction. 
				Thanks to <a href="https://seominjoon.github.io" target="_blank">Minjoon Seo</a> who worked with me and gave a lot of help.
			</p>
			<h4>Seoul National University (2016)</h4>
			<p>
				I was an undergraduate research intern during summer, in <a href="http://vision.snu.ac.kr/" target="_blank">Vision&Learning Lab</a>, advised by <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~gunhee/" target="_blank">Gunhee Kim</a>.
				I worked on image captioning - generating sentence given an image.
				My lab members are super admirable.
			</p>
			<h4>Seoul National University (2016)</h4>
			<p>
				I participated in Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program, advised by <a href="http://ids.snu.ac.kr/wiki/Sang-goo_Lee" target="_blank">Sang-gu Lee</a>.

			<h3>Interesting Courses</h3>
			
			<p>
				<span>Stanford CS231n, CS224d</span> were available online, and I was highly motivated by these lectures.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thanks to <span>Logic Design</span> and <span>Data Structure</span>, I was able to get a good grasp of the basics in computer science. <span>Programming Language</span> and <span>Automata Theory</span> were super super good lectures.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Intro. to Mathematical Analysis (I)</span> was so challenging but excited. I also enjoyed <span>Understanding of Korean Contemporary History</span> and <span>Psychology of Interpersonal Relations</span>.
			</p>
			<p>
				I took <span>CSE544 (Priciple of DBMS)</span> in UW, and it was so great. It was also a great opportunity to study and work on a project with graduate students.

			<h3>Personal</h3>
			<p>
				My favorite is shopping, watching youtube, riding bicycle, chatting with friends with eating sweets (or other fattening foods XD) , and so on.
			</p>
			<p>
				I like traveling occasionally. Recently I lived in Seattle for six months and went on a trip to San Francisco (including Menlo Park, Palo Alto, and Berkeley). My favorite place for trip is a resort like Guam or Philippine or a city. My desired place for next trip is New York.
			</p>
			<p>
				What I do best is to concentrate on my work for hours, sitting in a cafe with Caramel Frappuccino. What I do worst is to cook. (I'd rather starve...)
